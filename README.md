OBJECTIVE
The primary objective of this project is to develop a simple vulnerability scanning tool that can: 1.Identify Open Ports: Scan a target network or website to find open ports that may be susceptible to attacks. 2.Detect Outdated Software Versions: Check for known vulnerabilities in software versions running on the target system. 3.Identify Misconfigurations: Look for common misconfigurations that could lead to security vulnerabilities.

KEY COMPONENTS
Port Scanning: Use techniques such as TCP SYN scan to identify open ports on a target. Implement a timeout mechanism to avoid long wait times.
Version Detection: Retrieve software version information from services running on open ports. Use a database of known vulnerabilities (like the National Vulnerability Database) to match versions against known issues.
Configuration Checks: Perform basic checks for common misconfigurations (e.g., default credentials, unnecessary services running).
TECHNOLOGY USED
Python: For implementing the core algorithms and logic.
